Start Harness:
node ./config/dev_server


THINGS THAT ARE MISSING 
1. Styles from windrush app
2. Button component
3. Switch Case component
4. Icon Component
5. handleChange - has all redux stuff as well, and populateState function
	-Store
	-Reducers
	-Actions
6. It seems like the app automatically wraps <div>TEXT<Button do something/></div> Text in span tags
7. Bower Components
	-Font awesome
	-d3
	-jquery
	-modernizer
	-sweetalert

dist folder - contains compiled styles

figure out what in the component editor is miniumly nessasary
	-populate state
	-handleChange
